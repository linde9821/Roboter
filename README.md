# Roboter
This is a robotics school project developed by a friend of mine and myself. The Java-Project in this repository is the software to control the 3d-printed gripper with Dynamixel servo. The project is using source code provided by Dynamixel (ROBOTIS Dynamixel SDK (Protocol1.0/2.0)) under the Apache License Version 2.0. The project uses protocol 1.0. It is also uisng my own Java Library with the class ControlInput to autocorrect inputerrors. 

The source codes in the dynamixel package is basically the code provided by Dynamixel. It might be possible that minore changes have been made to those. The original version can be found her: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK

We are using the dynamixel AX-12A servo, the USB2AX v3.2b controller and RoboPlus software. The IDE is Eclipse Oxygen.

Right now it is still in development and not fully working. Error might and problably will be occure. 
Some parts of the project are currently partially written in german. It is planned to update those.

Cheers!
