Hey User,

please read this to make sure everything works.

Make sure you have the dxl_x64_c.dll library in your System32 folder or what ever the equivalent linux or mac folder is.
The libraries can be found hear:

Or look for it at the official GitHub page frome dynamixel:

https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK

If you need to change the devicename (on Windows this should be something like COM1, COM2, ..., COM5) start the program
from the command line with the argument you need for the devicename. You can find the devicename under your device manager.
If the devicename is "COM3" you dont need to change it because this is the default devicename.
It should look something like this:

C:\Your\current\path>Robot.jar COM2

Also make sure you got the latest Java-version installed because this is a Java program! 

Cheers!
